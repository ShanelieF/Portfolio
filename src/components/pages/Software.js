                          <p >
                        The main aim for this project was to create a derivative trade monitor, whereby trades could be inputted by a
                        user and then validated, suggesting possible errors and rejecting invalid inputs, these trades will then be
                        stored and accessible for editing. The project will also be able to produce a report of all the derivative trades
                        for a given day and display this to the user, these reports will be saved so they can be accessed again.
                          </p>

                          <p >
                          This was a group project so initially the team ran a whiteboarding session to obtain initial ideas for the structure and approach to the project,
                         this involved outlining our distinct components and the functions of each component. The project was broken down
                         into three distinct sections, a web app, an API and a mobile app.

                          </p>

                          I was half of the front end team in the project and was also responsible for integreting the backend and frontend.

                      for the main pages. The landing pages
                      would consist of cards which when hovered present more information about the action. </p>

                      <p>
                      The UI differs slightly from the mock-up designs provided in the design document.
                      The interface mainly uses neutral colours as it looks simplistic and makes the design look modern.
                      This allows user to avoid distractions and focus on the main content.
                      The homepage varies from the design as it was stated that icons will be used for recognition and ease of understanding.
                      This was changed as the webpage appeared empty and did not seem to be user friendly. It was also because icons
                      for tasks such as filling trades, archives, reports arenâ€™t easy to recognise.
                      To webpage is responsive so can be used on desktops, tablets as well as mobiles but to improve a mobile app could be made.
                      Furthermore, the webpage uses icons for the navbar but to imrove thsi will be changed to nav links as its easier for the user.
