                    <p>  Having moved to the UK at age 12, I quickly accomodated to a different culture. My schooling experience in India has made me
                    competitive and has directed me to being focused to achieve my goals.
                    Having completed my GCSEâ€™s and A-levels in the UK, I have enjoyed the application and tutorial approach.
                    The different approaches to learning have influenced me to be the person I am â€“ focused, tenacious and determined.</p>
                    <p>  At school, I've always been interested in both Design and Technology. When it came to
                      choosing a degree to study, I was conflicted between Graphic design and Computer Science. I chose the latter and
                      it has been a great experience so far!</p>
                    <p>  Through the ups and downs of university I have become resillent and persistent to achieve my goals. Constantly learning
                      something new and being passioante about a project makes me happy. My aspiration is to become an UI/UX designer as it
                      combines my interest in both Design and Technology.
